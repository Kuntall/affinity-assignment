One interesting dataset that I recently discovered is the Open Images V6 Dataset. It is a large-scale image dataset containing over 9 million images, each annotated with a set of object bounding boxes, object segmentation masks, visual relationships, and localized narratives. The dataset covers a wide range of object categories, from common objects like "car" and "dog" to more specific categories like "croissant" and "fire hydrant".

What makes this dataset particularly interesting is its size and the richness of its annotations, which make it suitable for a wide range of computer vision tasks, including object detection, instance segmentation, visual relationship detection, and scene understanding. The dataset is also constantly growing and evolving, with new images and annotations being added regularly.
